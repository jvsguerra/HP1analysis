# HIV-1 Protease analysis (HP1analysis)

A set of HIV-1 protease were extracted from RCSB PDB in March 1st to evaluate the structures in bound and unbound states and how it affects their active binding site.

Total number of structures: 237

- X-ray structures: 234
  - Bound state: 215
    - Open state: 14 (3ots, 3oty, 3ou1, 3ou3, 3ou4, 3oua, 3oub, 3ouc, 3oud, 3r0w, 3r0y, 4eyr, 4l1a, 4yoa)
    - Closed state: 201
  - Unbound state: 18
    - Open state: 15
    - Closed state: 3 (1g6l, 1lv1, 3ixo)

## Cavity analysis

To perform cavity detection and characterization on the structures, run:

```bash
bash run.sh
```
